If Mongo does not want to start after reboot, connect to it with Mongo-Compass
and initialize the replicaset with the command from docker/initdb.d/init-mongo.js

This might help in docker-compose.yml but requires testing:
    restart: unless-stopped
    entrypoint: >
      /bin/sh -c '
      echo "rs.initiate()" > /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init-replicaset.js;
      /usr/local/bin/docker-entrypoint.sh mongod --replSet rs0 --bind_ip localhost
      '
