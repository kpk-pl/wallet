In receipt.py there are 3 round(). They should round just like JS to the closest float, not to 2 places
This is a bigger problem that I tried to aviod for a long time now. The proper solution would be to
convert all prices, quantities, finalQuantities, provisions and currencyConversions as well as quotes to
be using decimal.Decimal. In this way calculations would be much simpler.
Adding two decimals does not change precision. Multiplying a decimal changes precision accordingly, but this can be
easily rounded as in
v = decimal.Decimal("2.5")
x = decimal.Decimal("2.0")
precision = abs(v.as_tuple().exponent)
result = round(v*x, precision)

Unit Tests for profit analyzer, especially for historical pricing
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The results page can have a chart like on wallet too
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Adding a pricing source -> support tags
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Update the ApexChart on the wallet page so that there is a button to zoom out. This will mean additional pricing
data needs to be pulled from backend and series modified accordingly.

Strategy edit page -> when a submit button is clicked the currently edited row changed data does not get reflected in
the fancytree model and then not saved to database
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Change handling of the "coded" field. Rename it to "Transaction ID". Allow setting this on the asset creation page as
a checkbox.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Stretegy -> button to rebalance all and populate inputs
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wallet aggregated -> display sparklines for the merged items
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Strategy -> Chart with allocation dynamically updated
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each asset should have an additional settings fields 'taxes'. If the field is not present then no taxes should apply.
Format of the field:
taxes: {
  type: "automatic" | "profit",
  percentage: 19
}
Automatic means that the taxes are already included in the 'provisions' fields. The 'profit' means that taxes can be
estimated from the netProfit field.

Use gather NBP course of currency pairs. There needs to be another list field in the 'currencyPair' field in the
quoteId with a list of labels. Then a specific currency pair quote can be selected for calculations of taxes.

Use the NBP course to sum up all taxes that need to be applied. For SELL operations with the matched ones this should
include Belka tax. For the DIVIDEND, also Belka tax. For the RECEIVE I need to research.

A pricing source should have a possibility to have multiple URIs and/or symbols as well as a possibility to pick
  up a priority of source for pricing. In general we could have a configurable master priority ladder for all pricing
  sources and then a particular pricing source could define a preffered one as well.
